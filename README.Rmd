# ReplicationRelevance

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package was designed to collect code written for the analysis of my master thesis. 
As such, it is not written in a very generalizable way. 
However, it does build a skeleton upon which a useful package could be built.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StefanThoma/ReplicationRelevance")
```

For an example call the vignette at:
``` r
vignette("ReplicationRelevance", package = "ReplicationRelevance")
```
