# ReplicationRelevance

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package was designed to collect code written for the analysis of my
master thesis. As such, it is not written in a very generalizable way.
However, it does build a skeleton upon which a useful package could be
built.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StefanThoma/ReplicationRelevance")
```

For an example see [the main vignette](doc/ReplicationRelevance.html)
