#' Text from my thesis:
#' The study conducted by Schwarz et al. (1985) investigated the effect of the
#' design of questionnaire-scales (scalesgroup) on the information reported by
#' participants (unintuitively labelled scales).
#' SpeciÔ¨Åcally, they randomly assigned N = 132 participants either into
#' the low category or the high category group.
#' Participants were asked to rate how many hours of tv they watched per
#' day on a questionnaire.
